cjsTemplate is a small template system written in javascript.  The parser is based on zparse.

Use:

var templateString = fs.read("templates/dtkChrome.html");
var template = Template(templateString);
var output = template.process(object);

In general it looks like Django Templates, but is not a direct match nor does it come presupplied with all of those formatters.

Further documentation and code to come.
